# coursera-algorithms-assignments

Assignments for the Algorithms Part 1 (https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) and Algorithms Part 2 (https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2) courses offered by Princeton University through Coursera.

Individual README files can be found in each assignment folder.

## Code dependencies 
* The application code for each assignment requires Java 8 or greater to run
* To run the code for each assignment you will also need to download and include the following JAR file: https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar

## Test dependencies
* The unit tests for each assignment require JUnit 5

## Further comments
These assignments were the first significant coding that I had done in Java. As such you may see a difference in coding style between the assignments, as I became more familiar with the language and it's features.

You may notice that for some of these assignments there is no main client that executes all of the functionality implemented in the code.
The API specification for the public methods of each of the classes was given in the assignment description and they were called by the assignment grader.

For more details on what the public methods of each class does, you can read through the assignment description linked in each week's README.
You can also run the unit tests for each class to see example expected behavior.
